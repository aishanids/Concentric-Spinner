# Concentric-Spinner
Animated concentric spinner
Find the tutorial here: https://frontend.horse/articles/concentric-circle-spinner/

This project displays three animated spinners.

The spinner uses a nested compuonding effect to make the interior spin faster and more frequently than the exterior elements.
A custom bezier curve gives the 'springy' feel to the spinner as it starts and stops.
